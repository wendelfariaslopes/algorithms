/**
 * Electricity is a very special commodity. It is economically non-storable, and
 * power system stability requires a constant balance between production and
 * consumption At the same time, electricity demand depends on weather
 * (temperature, wind speed, precipitation, etc.) and the intensity of business
 * and everyday activities (on-peak vs. off-peak hours, weekdays vs. weekends,
 * holidays and near-holidays, etc.)
 * 
 * A variety of methods and ideas have been tried for electricity price
 * forecasting (EPF), with varying degrees of success.

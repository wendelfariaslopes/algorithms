/**
 * 
 * Brownian produces a function graph that approximates a simple example of
 * fractional Brownian motion known as Brownian bridge. You can think of this
 * graph as a random walk that connects the two points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1),
 * controlled by a few parameters. The implementation is based on the midpoint
 * displacement method, which is a recursive plan for drawing the plot within
 * the x-interval [x0, x1]. The base case (when the size of the interval is
 * smaller than a given tolerance) is to draw a straight line connecting the two
 * endpoints. The reduction case is to divide the interval into two halves,
 * proceeding as follows:
 * 
 * 1) Compute the midpoint (xm, ym) of the interval.
 * 
 * 2) Add to the y-coordinate ym of the midpoint a random value Î´, drawn from
 * the Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and a given variance.
 * 
 * 3) Recur on the subintervals, dividing the variance by a given scaling factor S (smoothness).
 * 
 * The shape of the curve is controlled by two parameters: the volatility
 * (initial value of the variance) controls the distance the graph strays from
 * the straight line connecting the points, and the Hurst exponent controls the
 * smoothness of the curve.

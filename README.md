# Algorithms 

### Algorithms is Open Source Java code to do mathematics, linear algebra and optimisation. It’s what you need for data science, machine learning and scientific computing.

1. Algoritms is the fastest pure Java linear algebra library available. That statement is backed by the latest Java Matrix Benchmark results 
– that’s a third party independent benchmark (not written by anyone associated with Algo). 
2. Optimisation (mathematical programming) tools including LP, QP and MIP solvers – again this is pure Java with zero dependencies.
3. A collection of “array” classes that can be sparse or dense and arbitrarily large. They can be used as 1-, 
2- or N/Any-dimensional arrays, and may contain/handle a multitude of different number types including complex numbers, 
rational numbers and quaternions. The memory for the arrays can alternatively be allocated off heap or in a file. The linear algebra 
part of ojAlgo builds on these arrays – they’re fast and efficient.
4. Artificial Neural Networks Various other things like time series, random numbers, stochastic processes, descriptive statistics…
